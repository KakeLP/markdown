Taking accurate measurements is crucial for good results with our designs, yet not as trivial as you would think.

Wir haben ein paar Indikatoren hinzugef√ºgt, die Ihnen helfen sollen, Fehler oder Probleme beim Massnehmen.

 - We include [estimates for your different measurements][2], and highlight those measurements where a person differs significantly from the estimate
 - Your models show [a graph of their body measurements][2] in comparison to our standard sizes
