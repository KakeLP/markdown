## Step 1: Close the back dart

First thing we're going to do is close the waist dart on the back panel.

To do so, fold the back panel double with _good sides together_ making sure to match both sides of the dart on top of each other.

Now sew the dart close, making sure to use a small stitch length, and to sew all teh way to the end of the dart, even a couple of stitches off the fabric.

<Note>

Your back darts should be of equal length. Make sure to sew them precisely.

</Note>

## Step 2: Construct the back pockets

Follow [our double welt pocket instructions](/docs/sewing/double-welt-pockets/) to create the back welt pockets.

<Note>

Since these are chinos, you can/should edgestitch around the welt opening.
It's not strictly required for welt pockets, and typically not done on classic trousers (and thus not should in
the instructions) but it's a very typically finish for chinos, and makes it easier to keep everything in place.

</Note>

### Attach the back pocket facing to the pocket bag

Join the back pocket facing to the pocket bag by placing them with _good sides together_ and sewing along the longest of the non-curved seams of the facing.

When you're done, press the seam allowance to the side of the pocket bag.

### Attach the back pocket bag

Sew the bottom of the pocket bag to the bottom welt. Press it down when done.

Now align the top of the pocket bag with the waist and sew it down in the waist's seam allowance.

### Close the pocket back

Fold the leg panel out of the way so you can close both sides of the pocket bag.

<Note>

Make sure to also sew the pocket welts down on the pocket bag

</Note>

You should overlock/serge the sides of the pocketbag so they don't ravel.

<Tip>

If you don't have a _serger_ you can always use a zig-zag stitch instead. 

</Tip>

## Step 3: Overlock the front and back edges

Before we go any further, we'll overlock/serge the edges of the front and back panels of the legs. Make sure to also catch the top of the pocket bag when doing the back panels.

What we want to to prevent these edges from ravelling after we've completed our trousers, and now is the best time to do so.

## Step 4:  Construct the front pockets

The front pockets are a little unusual because they have the appearance of classic slanted pockets, but are constructed on the side seam.

### Attach the front pocket facings to the pocket bags

We have two front pocket bags, that each have two pieces of facing to attach to them.

Align them with _good sides together_ (\*) and sew the facing in place.

<Note>

(\*) With a pocket bag, it's not so obvious what the good side should be.

Do you want the good side to be what you feel when you put your hand in your pocket?
Or do you want it to be what you see when your trousers lie on the floor with their insides showing.

There's no right or wrong answer here. You do you.

</Note>

### Mark the pocket notch on pocket facing, and front and back leg panels

There's a notch on both front and back leg panels that indicates up to what point the pocket facing should be attached to the side seam.

Make sure to transfer this notch to both the (edge of the) pocket facing and the front trouser leg, since it's important we match them.

### Pin or base the pocket to the front and back leg panel

Both on the front and the back leg panel, we're going to sew the pocket facing to the side seam.

However, this needs to be precise, so you really want to make sure you either pin or baste it in place.

<Note>

Start with the front, since that's the easier seam. Once you've got some practice, you can do the back

</Note>

### Sew the front pocket in place

Sew from the waist down right until the notch that indicates where to stop.
