## Step 1: Close the back dart

First thing we're going to do is close the waist dart on the back panel.

To do so, fold the back panel double with _good sides together_ making sure to match both sides of the dart on top of each other.

Now sew the dart close, making sure to use a small stitch length, and to sew all teh way to the end of the dart, even a couple of stitches off the fabric.

<Note>

Your back darts should be of equal length. Make sure to sew them precisely.

</Note>

## Step 2: Construct the back pockets

Follow [our double welt pocket instructions](/docs/sewing/double-welt-pockets/) to create the back welt pockets.

<Note>

Since these are chinos, you can/should edgestitch around the welt opening.
It's not strictly required for welt pockets, and typically not done on classic trousers (and thus not should in
the instructions) but it's a very typically finish for chinos, and makes it easier to keep everything in place.

</Note>

### Attach the back pocket facing to the pocket bag

Join the back pocket facing to the pocket bag by placing them with _good sides together_ and sewing along the longest of the non-curved seams of the facing.

When you're done, press the seam allowance to the side of the pocket bag.

### Attach the back pocket bag

Sew the bottom of the pocket bag to the bottom welt. Press it down when done.

Now align the top of the pocket bag with the waist and sew it down in the waist's seam allowance.

### Close the pocket back

Fold the leg panel out of the way so you can close both sides of the pocket bag. 

<Note>

Make sure to also sew the pocket welts down on the pocket bag

</Note>

You should overlock/serge the sides of the pocketbag so they don't ravel.

<Tip>

If you don't have a _serger_ you can always use a zig-zag stitch instead. 

</Tip>

## Step 3: Overlock the front and back edges

Before we go any further, we'll overlock/serge the edges of the front and back panels of the legs.
Make sure to also catch the top of the pocket bag when doing the back panels.

What we want to to prevent these edges from ravelling after we've completed our trousers,
and now is the best time to do so.

## Step 4:  Construct the front pocket opening

The front pockets are a little unusual because they have the appearance of classic slanted pockets, but are constructed on the side seam.

### Attach the front pocket facings to the pocket bags

We have two front pocket bags, that each have two pieces of facing to attach to them.

Align them with _good sides together_ (\*) and sew the facing in place.

<Note>

(\*) With a pocket bag, it's not so obvious what the good side should be.

Do you want the good side to be what you feel when you put your hand in your pocket?
Or do you want it to be what you see when your trousers lie on the floor with their insides showing.

There's no right or wrong answer here. You do you.

</Note>

### Mark the pocket notch on pocket facing, and front and back leg panels

There's a notch on both front and back leg panels that indicates up to what point the pocket facing should be attached to the side seam.

Make sure to transfer this notch to both the (edge of the) pocket facing and the front trouser leg, since it's important we match them.

### Pin or base the pocket to the front and back leg panel

Both on the front and the back leg panel, we're going to sew the pocket facing to the side seam.

However, this needs to be precise, so you really want to make sure you either pin or baste it in place.

<Note>

Start with the front, since that's the easier seam. Once you've got some practice, you can do the back

</Note>

### Sew the front pocket in place

Sew from the waist down right until the notch that indicates where to stop.

### Press the front pocket slant

Now press the slant of the front pocket, both on the back and front panel, so that it's a sharp crease.

## Step 5:  Close the outseam

### Baste the front pockets shut

I strongly advice you to baste the pocket shut/in place before sewing this seam so that you know it's precise.

Closing the outseam means to place front and back panel with good sides together, and sew the outer seam.
That's easy enough at the legs, but at the top we have our pocket, which complicates things.

### Sew the top of the outer seam until the top notch of the pocket slant

Make sure everything is neatly aligned. Then sew from the top of the waist down to the top notch (this is just over a cm or half an inch).


### Sew the bottom of the outer seam from the bottom notch of the pocket slant

Now move to the bottom notch of the pocket slant, and sew from there all the way to the bottom of the legs.

### Press the outer seam open

When you're done, make sure to press the seam allowance open along the leg. Don't press the pocket, we already did that.

## Step 6:  Finish the front pocket bag

### Sew pocket bag close inside-out

With our pocket opening constructed and outer seam closed, we should now finish the pocket bag.

Pull the pocket bag out so that it dangles on the outside of the trouser leg. Then place both halves together and
either use a serger to finish the edge, or sew closely to the edge.

Make sure you end up at the point where the bottom part of the outer seam starts.

### Finish pocket bag edge

When you're done, you can flip the pocket bag back to the inside of the trouser leg.

Our pocket bag is now closed, but when we put our hand in it, you can feel the raw edge of the seam allowance.
To avoid that, topstitch along the edge of the pocket bag, locking in the seam allowance.

<Note>
If your seam allowance is wide, you might want to trim it back first.
</Note>

## Step 7:  Bar-tack the pocket opening

At the place the leg down with the good side up, making sure the pocket bag lies flat and towards the front panel.

Now at the top and bottom of the pocket opening, place a bar-tack perpendicular to the outer seam.

## Step 8:  Close the inseam

With our front pockets finished, close the inseam of both legs. 

When you're done, press open the inseam.

## Step 9:  Close the crossseam

Make sure one leg is turned with the good side out, and the other has the good side in.

Not tuck the leg with the good side out inside the leg that has the good side in.
This way, they have their good sides against each other.

Aling the cross seam, starting at the back waist, pinning both halves together as you make your way
towards the fly. Stop at the lowest fly notch.

When you're done. Do it again. Always sew the cross seam twice. 
It's one of those best practices you ignore at your own peril.

<Tip>

Take extra care to carefully align the seams where both legs have their back and front panels joined together.
Doing so will ensure your cross seam results with a perfectly aligned _cross_ where 4 pattern parts meet each other in a single point.

Getting it just right is one of those things you'll end up cherishing each time you wear these.

</Tip>

## Step 10: Construct the fly

### Close fly extension

Fold the fly extension on its fold line with good sides together.

Now sew along the bottom, to close the fly extension.

Trim back one half of the seam allowance to remove bulk before turning it good side out and pressing.

### Serge the fly extension and fly facing

Serge (or zig-zag) along the open side of the fly extension. No need to serge the top as that will get caught in our waistband.

while you're at it, also serge along the entirety of the fly facings J-shaped edge.
